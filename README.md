# Barracuda Inference YOLOX Demo BRP
A simple Unity BRP (Built-in Render Pipeline) project demonstrating how to perform object detection with the barracuda-inference-yolox package using the in-game camera.

### Disclaimer

The YOLOX object detection model used in the project is solely for demonstration purposes. Please be aware that it has not been trained to detect in-game objects and may not accurately identify or classify them. This implementation showcases the model's potential integration within Unity, and further training or adjustments may be necessary for specific in-game applications.



### Train a Custom Model
